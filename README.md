Description:

	For this project we will be constructing, pun intended, a website for a contractor. The website will include tools that will streamline the companyâ€™s project management capabilities while simultaneously improving customer service.

	In regards to project management we will need to implement tools that allow for customers to upload pictures to the website, while enabling the site administrator to access and orchestrate potential projects. This will help the contractor give customers estimates quickly and agree on projects in a speedy fashion, resulting in greater profits. There will be synergistic features that bolster both project management and customer communication. Being able to upload photos will not only help the owner generate more accurate estimates, but will also enable the customer to communicate their precise needs to the company without the need of an on-site consultation . To add to the ease of discussion between contractor and customer we will also incorporate some sort of chat or automatic email message system.

	As the tools mentioned above are being developed, we aim to create a website that is both functional and user friendly. Although we may take more pride in the work we do under the hood, it is important to remember the website is meant to serve many people who are not computer scientists. Humans are very visual creators and it would reflect poorly on the company to have a website that is not aesthetically pleasing. 


Vision Statement: 

	The purpose of this project is to help modernize an industry that is extremely important yet often overlooked. 


Motivation: 

	The construction industry is huge, especially in Colorado, but many private contractors operate with outdated websites and communication tools.


Risks: Only one of us has experience with web design.


Risk Mitigation: 

	We will do our best to research the material with which we are unfamiliar. To accomplish this skill gap we will also stay in touch with each other questions and ask question when needed.
